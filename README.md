To use scripts, need to open Matlab first and then open SPM in matlab. Best way to do this is:
(in relevant directory from terminal):
Please note, login1.nan and login2.nan only allow this (correct at time of writing). Other servers do not support opening SPM etc. 

module load spm
module load matlab 

Then in the matlab window type spm

Prior to using the scripts it is also necessary to load Marsbar. This can be done through the spm gui and has not been included in the scripts here.
